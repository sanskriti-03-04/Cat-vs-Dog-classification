# Cat-vs-Dog-classification

This model was built while I was learning from the tutorials on Youtube.
This is a classification model where the model identifies whether the given picture is that of a cat or a dog.
The training performance is visualized using matplotlib, and the model's effectiveness is evaluated on unseen data. 

Tech Stack used : 
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Matplotlib
Numpy / Pandas 

Features : 
Custom CNN training with real-time validation monitoring
Uses ModelCheckpoint to save only the best-performing model (best_model.h5)
Supports evaluation of model predictions against ground truth labels
Includes accuracy/loss plots for model diagnostics
